              The journey from taking Math 33X with Professor Steinerberger to developing my skills to the level of solving one of the unsolved problems he put forth that very year has been exhilarating.
              I am unbelievably grateful to him and all of my friends who made this possible. I’m publishing soon! A real mathematician!

              Looking back on the different skills I’ve learned and the output I’ve had, I’m confident in putting a full stop on this.
              Through all the identities I’ve had at UW, this one has led to some of the most fruitful interactions and has brought out the best evolution of my creative side.

              The most important role I’ve played at UW hasn’t been professional or hobby-driven, but my role as a friend.
              These are some of the best people on Earth. I won’t say much more and will let you enjoy the photos.
