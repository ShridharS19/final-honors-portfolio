  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
    My name is <strong>Shridhar Sinha</strong> (he/him), and I’m a senior at UW studying Computer Science and Mathematics enrolled in the Interdisciplinary Honors Program. When I arrived on campus, I felt like a chord strummed too quickly—vibrating with possibilities. By my second year I double-majored, joined Honors, volunteered on the UW Farm, recorded music, ran impromptu friend-group soccer, and leaned into every role I could find. In that sophomore haze, I believed that piling on experiences would somehow tune me into the person I was meant to be.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
    By junior year, the noise quieted into a pattern I thought I recognized—a picture of me! Established friend groups, a barrage of STEM classes that had me running around campus, constant musical inspiration, and direction for future research. I hit each mark, and was lost in the pattern of always having these familiar things to do. I felt a triumphant clarity—this was “me.”
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
    Senior year changed this view. When friends graduated, ideas dried up, and unglamorous responsibilities piled on—who am I then? Injuries benched my runs, graduation requirements reshuffled my courses, and the studio stayed silent without a new album. Those challenges forced me to strip back the layers and listen for the essential notes.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
    Now, I stand grounded in three identities I wear without reservation:
  </p>
  <ul style="
    margin-left: 1.25rem;
    margin-bottom: 1.25rem;
    list-style: disc;
  ">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
      <strong>Mathematician</strong> — A clear and satisfying line from lost student to mature scientist, able to understand and solve research-level questions with infinite patience and rigor. I’m publishing!
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
      <strong>Musician</strong> — A less linear journey that only makes sense looking back. It’s less about skill and more about embracing the ethos and aesthetics of creating art. Maturing means expressing myself more freely through my music.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
      <strong>Friend</strong> — Because every journey, however technical or artistic, has been shaped by the community that sustains me.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
    My Honors journey isn’t always a straight line but a feedback loop of experimentation, reflection, and refinement. I’ve learned that true growth emerges not from “having it all figured out,” but from embracing uncertainty, tuning into the voices around me, and choosing the roles that resonate most deeply. In this shoegaze-inspired tapestry of experiences, the strongest threads are the ones I carry forward.
